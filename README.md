# Visual novel engine (currently unnamed)

This is a smally hobby visual novel I am working on.

## compiling

NOTE: C3 is an experimental language, this project requires using the latest commit of the c3c compiler.
This is due to bugs in the compiler being frequent and me using this project partially to find and report them.

You may get the c3c compiler from here: https://github.com/c3lang/c3c

```sh
make
```

## TODO

### high
- [ ] Overlay over the game and ability to animate it

## Done

- [X] Command to turn textbox on and off
- [X] Add `block` keyword that will block without doing anything.
- [X] Implement saying text as characters, i.e `bob "Hello!"`.

- [X] Refactor big imgui chunk of code into its own module and put it behind a keybind
- [X] Playing music
- [X] Logging module.
  + [X] Handles multithreading.
  + [X] Cross-platform terminal colors. (Fuck windows you dont get colors, get a better terminal)
  + [X] Log into both terminal STDOUT and into the debug system in a text box.
- [X] Refactor multi-threaded asset loading to not use `ThreadPool` but instead just create and detach a bunch of threads to avoid blocking in the case where there are more than 32 assets.
  + Instead just increased threadpool cap to ridiculous amount, stack memory is cheap.
- [X] Implement animation type for flipping the character direction.
- [X] Add `pause` animation type
- [X] Fix stepping through VM.
- [X] Move the vm stepping code into `vm.c3`.
